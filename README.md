# go the terminal and run - npm i --force
# you need to change the uri of mongodbUri in app.js with new one 
# run -  node app.js 
# and use postman or other api testing tools to check the working of the api code



# Which database you have chosen and why?
# i choose mongodb for database
# I have chosen MongoDB as the database for this Nodejs backend server for menu management. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is an ideal choice for applications with rapidly changing data requirements, such as the menu management system in this assignment



# 3 things that you learned from this assignment?
# Working with Node.js and Express.js to build a RESTful API server.
# Designing a database schema for storing hierarchical data in MongoDB.
# Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for menu management.



# What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
# The most challenging part of the assignment was implementing the search functionality for items by name. This involved optimizing the query to ensure efficient search results.



# What you would have done differently given more time?
# Given more time, I would have created frontend and connected api(of backend) with it . Additionally, I would have added authentication and authorization to secure the API endpoints and restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles
